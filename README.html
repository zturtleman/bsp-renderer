  <H2> Introduction</H2>
bsp-renderer is an open source application for displaying levels stored in the quake3 bsp map format. 
It allows the user to move around in the levels using a first person camera and collision detection.
It is released under the GNU General Public License version 3 (<a href="http://www.gnu.org">www.gnu.org</a>)  
The purpose of this document is to give an overview of the bsp-renderer application, including 
how to use it, which third party libraries and third party code it uses and other technical information.
This distribution of the program contains the source code and prebuilt executables. It also contains 
the libraries necessary to build the source, and a level called "The Forlorn Hope", which can be found
 at <a href="http://www.users.on.net/justonefix/">http://www.users.on.net/justonefix/</a>. bsp-renderer is currently in version 0.7 and
 is hosted at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bsp-renderer">code.google.com/p/bsp-renderer</a>
 <p>
bsp-renderer is intended as a starting point for implementing first person shooters, or similar games. 
The reason I created it is that I wanted to porgram an FPS-like game from scratch (well almost anyway, the map format was created by Id Software).
Of course, there is a long way to go before bsp-renderer can be called an FPS, hence the name.
It's about 4000 lines of code, and the GPL notice at the beginning of each files accounts for 500 of these.
 </p>
 
 <H3> How to run the application</H3>
 The project contains two configurations, debug and release. The prebuilt executable is a release build, which has the flag RELEASE_BUILD set.
 This flag adjusts were the application looks for the default map. If the application finds a bsp.cfg file in its running directory, it will parse this 
 file to set which map to load. See the example file for an explanation of the syntax. If no file is present, or no file or map is set in the file, the default map will be 
 loaded ("The Forlorn Hope" found in the 'media' folder). The application will exit if it cannot find the map or data file bsp.cfg specifies. 
 Alos, the runtime library zlib1.dll needs to be in the run directory, if it does not exist in the default Windows dll directories.
 <H4> Keys</H4>
 Use WASD and mouse to move around.<BR>
 F1: disable collision detection.<BR>
 F2: enable collision detection without gravity<BR>
 F3: enable collision detection with gravity<BR>
 F8: toggle full screen mode<BR>
 <H3> Building bsp-renderer </H3>
 You will need a DirectX SDK, probably version 9.0c, it is not tested with earlier versions. You will also need MS Visual 2008 (the free express version will do).
 To build bsp-renderer Visual studio needs to have the paths of the DirectX libraries and include files in the VC++ directories settings (click 'options' in the 'tools' menu). 
 Zziplib.lib, the external library used by bsp-renderer is included in the release and will be linked automatically when building. 
 The usage of hardware vertex processing can't be adjusted dynamically in the current state of bsp-renderer. Use the NO_HW_VERTEXPROCESSING preprocessor definition
 to toggle this. Originally, bsp-renderer always used HW vertex processing, but I had to work on a laptop which didn't support it, hence this option.
 <H3> Limitations</H3>  
 <p>
Quake III uses "shader files" for the moving and animated parts of the map, these files are not used by bsp-renderer in its present state.
</p>
<p>
The collision detection does not seem to work well with curved surfaces.
</p>
<p>
The "physics" (i.e. the gravity) is only rudimentary and quite rough
</p>
<p>
Although it is quite fast, it could be faster. The drawing of the bezier patches is most likely not optimal. 
It seems they were designed for the OpenGL command glMultiDrawElementsEXT() In DirectX, I had to replace this with a loop and multiple 
calls to DrawIndexedPrimitive().
</p>
<p>
The check for the capabilities of the graphics card is a bit limited.
The use of hardware vertex processing is not dynamic, meaning that if you run the executable using it on
 a graphics card where it is not supported, the program will exit.

<H2> Licensing </H2>  
bsp-renderer is released under GPL version 3. However, it relies on third party libraries, 
as well as pieces of source code from other open source programs. An overview of these libraries and source code is given here. 
The licenses mentioned can be found in the 'licenses' folder.

<H3> Source code licenses</H3>
Two parts of the source code are based on algorithms originally from other open source applications. 
<p>- The source for the collision detection (but not the collision response) is based on code from reference [3] above, which in turn comes 
from the Quake III source. </p>
<p>- The tessellation of the Bezier patches is based on code from reference [1]. The code originally comes from the Octagon Engine.</p>
