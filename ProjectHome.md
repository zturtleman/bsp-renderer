bsp-renderer is a directx program for displaying levels stored in the bsp file format used in quake 3. It allows the user to move around in the levels using a first person camera and basic collision detection. Most of the static geometry from the maps, including curved surfaces, can be handled. It is written in c++.

The current release includes both windows executables and source code, along with project files for visual studio 9.
